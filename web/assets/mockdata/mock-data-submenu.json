        "recipe": "Beat eggs and red pepper flakes together in a bowl. Stir tomatoes, feta, and basil leaves into egg mixture. Heat olive oil in a nonstick skillet over high heat until oil starts to shimmer. Pour egg mixture into hot oil and cook, without stirring, for 5 seconds. Cook and stir egg mixture until eggs are scrambled and softly set, about 30 seconds. Transfer eggs to a plate and sprinkle with sea salt.",
        "review": "Cooking isn't about always doing the right thing, and this summer scramble is a perfect example. Adding juicy, sweet cherry tomatoes to a scramble tastes great, but it's not a common practice since having a pool of liquid under your eggs is considered bad form. I don't care; I have toast. Try to find a goat milk feta cheese for this; it's awesome!",
